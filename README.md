# üß¨ lncRNA-Workflow

**A modular and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for identification and analysis of lncRNAs from RNA-seq data.**

This pipeline is designed to start directly from **SRA accession IDs** and automate the full process of identifying both known and novel **long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)** using a set of standard and powerful tools. It‚Äôs ideal for beginners who want a reproducible way to analyze RNA-seq data with minimal setup.

## üìñ Overview

lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but often regulate gene expression. This pipeline provides a **start-to-finish workflow**: from downloading RNA-seq data (via SRA) to predicting high-confidence lncRNAs using multiple tools and filters.

## üîÅ Workflow Summary

The figure below shows the structure of the pipeline:

![Workflow Graph](rulegraph.png)

### Key Steps:

1. **get_reads** ‚Äì Automatically downloads RNA-seq datasets using SRA IDs (via `fastq-dump` or `prefetch`).
2. **cutadapt_trim & cutadapt_filter** ‚Äì Removes adapter sequences and filters low-quality reads.
3. **hisat2_index** ‚Äì Builds genome index from the reference genome.
4. **hisat2_alignment** ‚Äì Aligns reads to the reference genome.
5. **samtools_sort** ‚Äì Sorts aligned reads for assembly.
6. **stringtie_assembly** ‚Äì Assembles transcripts from the aligned reads.
7. **gffread** ‚Äì Processes the GTF file for compatibility.
8. **FEELncRNA, CPAT, lnc_finder** ‚Äì Apply multiple tools to identify lncRNAs based on coding potential.
9. **uniprot_blast** ‚Äì Removes known protein-coding transcripts.
10. **intersection** ‚Äì Combines filtered results from all tools to identify high-confidence lncRNAs.
11. **all** ‚Äì Final results.
