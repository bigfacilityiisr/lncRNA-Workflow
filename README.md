# üß¨ lncRNA-Workflow

**A modular and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for identification and analysis of lncRNAs from RNA-seq data.**

This pipeline is designed to start directly from **SRA accession IDs** and automate the full process of identifying both known and novel **long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)** using a set of standard and powerful tools. It‚Äôs ideal for beginners who want a reproducible way to analyze RNA-seq data with minimal setup.

## üìñ Overview

lncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) are transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that do not encode proteins but are involved in regulating gene expression, chromatin organization, and other cellular processes. 

This workflow provides a comprehensive method to:
- Download RNA-seq data from NCBI SRA
- Preprocess and align reads
- Assemble transcripts
- Apply multiple coding potential filters
- Identify high-confidence lncRNAs

## üîÅ Workflow Summary

The figure below shows the structure of the pipeline:

![Workflow Graph](rulegraph.png)

### Key Steps:

1. **get_reads** ‚Äì Automatically downloads RNA-seq datasets using SRA IDs (via `fastq-dump` or `prefetch`).
2. **cutadapt_trim & cutadapt_filter** ‚Äì Removes adapter sequences and filters low-quality reads.
3. **hisat2_index** ‚Äì Builds genome index from the reference genome.
4. **hisat2_alignment** ‚Äì Aligns reads to the reference genome.
5. **samtools_sort** ‚Äì Sorts aligned reads for assembly.
6. **stringtie_assembly** ‚Äì Assembles transcripts from the aligned reads.
7. **gffread** ‚Äì Processes the GTF file for compatibility.
8. **FEELncRNA, CPAT, lnc_finder** ‚Äì Apply multiple tools to identify lncRNAs based on coding potential.
9. **uniprot_blast** ‚Äì Removes known protein-coding transcripts.
10. **intersection** ‚Äì Combines filtered results from all tools to identify high-confidence lncRNAs.
11. **all** ‚Äì Final results.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bigfacilityiisr/lncRNA-Workflow.git
cd lncRNA-Workflow
```

## üöÄ How to Use

1. Edit the config.yaml file

Provide:
A list of SRA accession IDs under samples
Path to the reference genome and annotation file
Optional: Change paths and parameters if needed

Example:

samples:
  - SRR12345678
  - SRR87654321
genome: "data/genome.fa"
annotation: "data/annotation.gtf"

2. Run the Pipeline
```bash
snakemake --cores 4 --use-conda
```
This will:

-Download SRA datasets

-Preprocess and align reads

-Assemble transcripts

-Predict and filter lncRNAs

-Output a final list of confident lncRNA transcripts

## üì¶ Output
You‚Äôll get the following:

‚úÖ Assembled transcripts (.gtf)

‚úÖ Output from FEELnc, CPAT, lncFinder

‚úÖ BLAST results against UniProt

‚úÖ Filtered intersection of predictions

‚úÖ Final set of high-confidence lncRNAs

‚úÖ Log files for each rule

## üìä Visualization
To visualize the entire workflow as a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph):

snakemake --dag | dot -Tpng > rulegraph.png
This will generate a graphical representation of how the steps depend on each other.

## üôè Credits
This pipeline was developed as part of a Ginger lncRNA discovery project carried out by the Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics (BIG) Facility,
ICAR-Indian Institute of Spices Research, Kozhikode.

The work was conducted under the National Network Project on Crop Bioinformatics:NNP of NIPGR, New Delhi.

It integrates tools like FEELnc, CPAT, lncFinder, and BLAST+ into a reproducible and modular Snakemake workflow for effective discovery and characterization of long non-coding RNAs in plants.
